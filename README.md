# California Housing Price Prediction with Simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

- In this notebook I explored a simple regression problem with MLP
- Encountered the effects of overfitting when trained for higher epochs as shown in tensorboad logs
- Learned Early stopping and explored L1 Loss and MSE loss with Adam optimizer and learning rate of 1e-4
